     "The compulsory input file \"assignments_in\" should contain a text file where there is one row for each streamline, and each row contains a list of numbers corresponding to the parcels to which that streamline was assigned (most typically there will be two entries per streamline, one for each endpoint; but this is not strictly a requirement). This file will most typically be generated using the tck2connectome command with the -out_assignments option."

      "description": "Since only a single edge is of interest, this example provides only the two nodes involved in that edge to the -nodes option, adds the -exclusive option so that only streamlines for which both assigned nodes are in the list of nodes of interest are extracted (i.e. only streamlines connecting nodes 1 and 2 in this example), and writes the result to a single output track file."

      "code": "connectome2tck tracks.tck assignments.txt from_15_to_ -nodes 15 -keep_self",
      "description": "The command will generate the same number of track files as there are nodes in the parcellation: one each for the streamlines connecting node 15 to every other node; i.e. \"from_15_to_1.tck\", \"from_15_to_2.tck\", \"from_15_to_3.tck\", etc.. Because the -keep_self option is specified, file \"from_15_to_15.tck\" will also be generated, containing those streamlines that connect to node 15 at both endpoints."

      "description": "Here the command will generate one track file for every node in the connectome: \"node1.tck\", \"node2.tck\", \"node3.tck\", etc.. Each of these files will contain all streamlines that connect the node of that index to another node in the connectome (it does not select all tracks connecting a particular node, since the -keep_self option was omitted and therefore e.g. a streamline that is assigned to node 41 will not be present in file \"node41.tck\"). Each streamline in the input tractogram will in fact appear in two different output track files; e.g. a streamline connecting nodes 8 and 56 will be present both in file \"node8.tck\" and file \"node56.tck\"."

As such, by selecting all streamlines that are assigned to \"node 0\" (including those streamlines for which neither endpoint is assigned to a node due to use of the -keep_self option), the single output track file will contain all streamlines for which at least one of the two endpoints was not successfully assigned to a node."
