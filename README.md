NiWrap is an extensive collection of neuroimaging command line tool metadata used for generating modern, ideomatic Python wrappers.

Metadata is partly hand-written and partly extracted from the source code of the tools themselves.
NiWrap is based on the [Boutiques Descriptor Schema](https://github.com/boutiques/boutiques) and powered by the [Styx Boutiques-to-Python compiler](https://github.com/childmindresearch/styx).

> [!NOTE] 
> *API Coverage* is defined as the percentage of individual binaries for which a descriptor is available in NiWrap. This is not a measure of the completeness of the descriptors themselves nor is reaching 100% strictly necessary as e.g. FSL and AFNI contain many small utilities for which Python offers much easier standard library functions. One way to increase coverage is to mark known-irrelevant binaries as `"status": "ignore"` in `packages/`.
