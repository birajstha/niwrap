    CONNECTOME DB BACKEND COMMAND FOR CIFTI AVERAGE DENSE ROI.
    
    This command is probably not the one you are looking for, try
    -cifti-average-dense-roi. It takes the list of cifti files to average from
    standard input, and writes its output as little endian, 32-bit integer of
    row size followed by the row as 32-bit floats.
    
    Args:
        index_list: comma separated list of cifti indexes to average
        out_file: file to write the average row to
        runner: Command runner
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `BackendAverageDenseRoiOutputs`).
