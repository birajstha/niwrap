    Args:
        files: List of files to compare.
        old_dir: Directory containing the files to compare against.
        diff_opts: Add options to diff command (e.g., -w).
        diff_prog: Display diffs using a specified program (e.g., meld, xxdiff).
        ignore_missing: Continue even if files are missing.
        longlist: Run 'ls -l' on both directories instead of listing files.
        save: Create PDFs of diffs.
        show: Show diffs using 'diff'.
        xxdiff: Show diffs using 'xxdiff'.
        x_flag: Implies -xxdiff and -ignore_missing.
        verbosity: Set verbosity level (2 or 3).
