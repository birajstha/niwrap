    balloon by MK Belmonte.
    
    Simulation of haemodynamic response using the balloon model. Based on the
    theoretical model proposed by Buxton et al. (1998).
    
    Args:
        tr: Scan repetition time in seconds (TR), the interval at which the\
            output curve will be sampled.
        num_scans: Number of scans (N), the output curve will comprise this\
            number of samples.
        event_times: The name of a file containing the event timings, in\
            seconds, as ASCII strings separated by white space, with time 0 being\
            the time at which the initial scan occurred.
        t_rise: Haemodynamic rise time in seconds (typically between 4s and\
            6s).
        t_sustain: Haemodynamic sustain time in seconds (typically between 0s\
            and 4s).
        t_fall: Haemodynamic fall time in seconds (typically between 4s and\
            6s).
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `BalloonOutputs`).
