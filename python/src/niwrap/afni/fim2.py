    More information: https://example.com/fim2
    
    Args:
        image_files: Input MRI image files.
        pcnt: Correlation coefficient threshold will be 1 - 0.01 * #.
        pcthresh: Correlation coefficient threshold will be #.
        im1: Index of image file to use as first in time series; default is 1.
        num: Number of images to actually use; default is to use all images.
        non: Turn off default normalization of the output activation image.
        coef: Scaling factor to convert the activation output from floats to\
            short ints.
        ort: Filename of a time series to which the image data will be\
            orthogonalized before correlations are computed.
        ideal: Filename of a time series to which the image data is to be\
            correlated.
        polref: Use polynomials of order 0..# as extra 'orts'; default is 0.
        fimfile: Filename to save activation magnitudes in.
        corr: Indicates to write correlation output to image file\
            'fimfile.CORR'.
        corfile: Filename to save correlation image in.
        cnrfile: Filename to save contrast-to-noise image in.
        sigfile: Filename to save standard deviation image in.
        fitfile: Image files of the least squares fit coefficients of all the\
            -ort and -polref time series.
        subort: Filename of the new timeseries of images with the orts and\
            polrefs subtracted out.
        flim: Write outputs in mrilib 'float' format.
        clean: Output images won't have the +/- 10000 values forced into their\
            corners for scaling purposes.
        clip: Set to zero regions of low intensity in output correlations, etc.
        q: Quiet operation mode.
        dfspace: Use the 'dfspace' filter to register the images spatially\
            before filtering.
        regbase: Read image in file 'fname' as the base image for registration.
        runner: Command runner.
