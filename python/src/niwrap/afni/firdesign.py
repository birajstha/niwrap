    FIRdesign by AFNI Team.
    
    Uses the Remez algorithm to calculate the FIR filter weights for a bandpass
    filter; results are written to stdout in an unadorned (no header) column of
    numbers.
    
    More information:
    https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/FIRdesign.html
    
    Args:
        fbot: Lowest frequency in the pass band.
        ftop: Highest frequency in the pass band, must be higher than fbot and\
            <= 0.5/TR.
        ntap: Number of filter weights (AKA 'taps') to use, must be in the\
            range 8..2000 (inclusive).
        tr: Set time grid spacing to 'dd' [default is 1.0].
        alternative_band: Alternative way to specify the passband.
        alternative_ntap: Alternative way to specify the number of taps.
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `FirdesignOutputs`).
