    3dTqual by AFNI Team.
    
    Computes a quality index for each sub-brick in a 3D+time dataset.
    
    More information:
    https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dTqual.html
    
    Args:
        dataset: Input 3D+time dataset.
        spearman: Quality index is 1 minus the Spearman (rank) correlation\
            coefficient of each sub-brick with the median sub-brick (default\
            method).
        quadrant: Quality index is 1 minus the quadrant correlation coefficient\
            as the quality index.
        autoclip: Clip off low-intensity regions in the median sub-brick, only\
            compute correlation between high-intensity voxels.
        automask: Automatically mask and compute correlation only across\
            high-intensity (presumably brain) voxels.
        clip: Clip off values below given threshold in the median sub-brick.
        mask: Compute correlation only across masked voxels from the given\
            dataset.
        range_: Print the median-3.5*MAD and median+3.5*MAD values with each\
            quality index for plotting.
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `V3dTqualOutputs`).
