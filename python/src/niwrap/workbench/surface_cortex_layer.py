    Create surface approximating a cortical layer.
    
    The input surfaces must have vertex correspondence. The output surface is
    generated by placing vertices between the two surfaces such that the
    enclosed volume within any small patch of the new and white surfaces is the
    given fraction of the volume of the same patch between the pial and white
    surfaces (i.e., specifying 0 would give the white surface, 1 would give the
