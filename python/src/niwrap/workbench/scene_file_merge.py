    scene-file-merge by Washington University School of Medicin.
    
    REARRANGE SCENES INTO A NEW FILE.
    
    Takes one or more scene files and constructs a new scene file by
    concatenating specified scenes from them.
    
    Example: wb_command -scene-file-merge out.scene -scene-file first.scene
    -scene 1 -scene-file second.scene
    
    This example would take the first scene from first.scene, followed by all
    scenes from second.scene, and write these scenes to out.scene.
    
    Args:
        scene_file_out: output - the output scene file
        opt_scene_file_scene_file: specify a scene file to use scenes from: the
            input scene file
