    RECREATE SCENE FILE IN NEW LOCATION.
    
    Scene files contain internal relative paths, such that moving or copying a
    scene file will cause it to lose track of the files it refers to. This
    command makes a modified copy of the scene file, changing the relative paths
    to refer to the new relative locations of the files.
