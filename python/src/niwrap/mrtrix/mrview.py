    Any images listed as arguments will be loaded and available through the
    image menu, with the first listed displayed initially. Any subsequent
    command-line options will be processed as if the corresponding action had
    been performed through the GUI.
    
    Note that because images loaded as arguments (i.e. simply listed on the
    command-line) are opened before the GUI is shown, subsequent actions to be
    performed via the various command-line options must appear after the last
    argument. This is to avoid confusion about which option will apply to which
    image. If you need fine control over this, please use the -load or
    -select_image options. For example:
    
    $ mrview -load image1.mif -interpolation 0 -load image2.mif -interpolation 0
    
    or
    
    $ mrview image1.mif image2.mif -interpolation 0 -select_image 2
