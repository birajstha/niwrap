    """
    Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) is a C++ library available through the
    command line that computes high-dimensional mappings to capture the statistics
    of brain structure and function. It allows one to organize, visualize and
    statistically explore large biomedical image sets. Additionally, it integrates
    imaging modalities in space + time and works across species or organ systems
    with minimal customization.
    
    The ANTs library is considered a state-of-the-art medical image registration
    and segmentation toolkit which depends on the Insight ToolKit, a widely used
    medical image processing library to which ANTs developers contribute.
    ANTs-related tools have also won several international, unbiased
    competitions such as MICCAI, BRATS, and STACOM.

    Args:
        image_dimension: The dimensionality of the image. Use 2 or 3 for\
            spatial images, and 4 for 4D images like time-series data.
        output_image: The output image file resulting from the operations.
        image1: The first input image for the operation.
        image2: The second input image for the operation, if required.
        runner: Command runner.
