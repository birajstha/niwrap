    Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) is a C++ library available through the
    command line that computes high-dimensional mappings to capture the statistics
    of brain structure and function. It allows one to organize, visualize and
    statistically explore large biomedical image sets. Additionally, it integrates
    imaging modalities in space + time and works across species or organ systems
    with minimal customization.
    
    The ANTs library is considered a state-of-the-art medical image registration
    and segmentation toolkit which depends on the Insight ToolKit, a widely used
    medical image processing library to which ANTs developers contribute.
    ANTs-related tools have also won several international, unbiased
    competitions such as MICCAI, BRATS, and STACOM.

    Args:
        input_image: A scalar image is expected as input for noise correction.
        noise_model: Use different noise models each with its own (default)\
            parameters.
        output: The output consists of the noise corrupted version of the input\
            image.
        image_dimensionality: This option forces the image to be treated as a\
            specified-dimensional image. If not specified, the program tries to\
            infer the dimensionality from the input image.
        verbose: Verbose output.
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `AddNoiseToImageOutputs`).
